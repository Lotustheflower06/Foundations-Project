**Important Features/Classes**  
The most important functions for the password manager is the function to make a library in a file that can be encrypted and called upon later. Then if the user went to a website where they saved a password with my password manager, the program can see that and offer the password they saved when they go to the login screen.  

Important features for the one time password generator are gonna be for the program to generate a password through the random module into a variable and see if the users imputed password matches that variable to make sure its not some sort of bot. If you wanted to get really fancy, you could see how fast they type the input. The other important function is going to be to update the variable every time one is used so multiple people cant use the same number. 

**Design Pattern**  
The main 3 patterns i would use is the singleton pattern so I can generate single use passwords and encryption/decryption for the password manager.
